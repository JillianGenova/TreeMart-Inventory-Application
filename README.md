Contributors: Jillian Genova, Yash Butani, Leonardo Alfaro, Sidney Hestres

This application will implement a red-black tree which stores the inventory for a fictional store, TreeMart™. The data set contains a set of products, each with a unique item description and ID number. It will update the store’s inventory based on given user input. This could be used in any sort of warehouse, hardware store, or supermarket setting, as the application is easily adaptable to new forms of data.
